The code is divided into four packages:
	- game
		. This package contains monster-map-game specific classes and logic
	- graph
		. An implementatation of a directed-graph structure "DirectedNetwork".
		  This is used by the code in the "game" package to represent the game-map.
	- questions
		. executable classes that answer the questions posed in the brief
	- serialization
		. classes for use in serialization of "DirectedNetwork" instances.

My implementation of the sample-map is in the class questions.Utility#createExampleMap().
My path scoring is implemented with game.MonsterMapPathComparator and game.MonsterMapGamePathFinder
My custom serialization method is implemented in serialization.OptimizedSerialization
Random-map generation is implemented in game.MonsterMapGameMap#createRandomMap(int)

The code will build using maven:
	mvn package
(There is only one dependency on junit4)
There are bash-shell and windows-cmd scripts that run the executable classes in the "questions" package. 
(The bash scripts are tested in cygwin)
